# SellerApp-Assignment

Myself **AMAN NIM**.

This is with respect to the assignment given - "_TO SCRAP AN AMAZON WEB PAGE GIVEN IT'S URL_" for the role of Software Engineer/Backend Developer @SellerApp.
- I've used JAVA and the library "Jsoup" for scraping.
- The user has to enter the URL as an input, the ScrapAPI.getInfo() method is called which then prints the Product Name, Image URL, Description, Price and Total number of Reviews of the product.
- It also checks weather the Price provided is a Deal price or normal price, and then provides with the correct amount.
